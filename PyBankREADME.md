# PyBank-PyPoll-Challenge-
        Create Python script that analyzes the records of the file   
            # The total number of votes cast (to all candidates)
            # A list of candidates who recieved votes
            # Each candidate's total votes 
            # Each candidate's percent of votes
            # Determine winner
            # Export (print) results to text file
# Resources used was asking my son Eric Passeno questions who works as a Cyber Analyst and Python SME.  He provided advice on how to search the internet looking at code of simular exercises with the same premise of looping, compiling data and setting up text_files to show results.
# I also spent about 15 hours over break reworking class homework and reviewing Eric Matthes' 2nd Edition Python Crash Course.
