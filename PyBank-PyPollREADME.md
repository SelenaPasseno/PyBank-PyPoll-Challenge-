# PyBank-PyPoll-Challenge-
       PyPoll: 
        Create Python script that analyzes the records of the file:  
            # The total number of votes cast (to all candidates)
            # A list of candidates who recieved votes
            # Each candidate's total votes 
            # Each candidate's percent of votes
            # Determine winner
            # Export (print) results to text file

        PyBank:
        Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
            # Objective A: The total number of months included in the dataset  
            # Objective B: The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
            # Objective C: The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
            # Objective D: The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
            # Objective E: The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
            # Objective F: Print results to terminal
            # Objective G: Print results to a text file
            
         Resources used included class homework, searching youtube for videos explaining how to write loops and how to set up formatting, advice and discussions with Eric Passeno questions who works as a Cyber Analyst and Python SME (more confusion, but lots of practice).  
         He provided advice on how to search the internet looking at code and how to find exercises with the same premise of looping, compiling data and setting up text_files to show results.
         I also spent about 15 hours over break reworking class homework and reviewing Eric Matthes' 2nd Edition Python Crash Course (formatting and his Python Cheat Sheet helped!)
